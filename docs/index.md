# AdaStop

Sequential testing for efficient and reliable comparison of stochastic algorithms.

This package contains the AdaStop algorithm. AdaStop implements a *statistical test to adaptively choose the number of runs of stochastic algorithms* necessary to compare these algorithms and be able to rank them with a theoretically controlled family-wise error rate. One particular application for which AdaStop was created is to compare Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Please note, that what we call here *algorithm* is really *a certain implementation of an algorithm*.
